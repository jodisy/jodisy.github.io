        <h2>Sonder</h2><hr>
		<h4 style='color: #ffb9b9;'>december 2020</h4><br>
        <p>The word sonder means the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own. But recently I‚Äôve started wondering if there‚Äôs a word for the burning, irrational desire to understand a specific person's life as lucidly as you experience your own.</p>
        <p>Not because you admire them or wish to follow in their footsteps, but because you think that by walking around in their mind - their most private space - you will learn how to be a better person for them.</p>
        <p>It‚Äôs true that when you spend a couple hours alone with another person, they‚Äôll eventually share with you their deepest contemplations. But even as their personal stories cascade on and on, I can't help but think that all of that information passes through three filters.</p>
        <p>The first filter is that you don‚Äôt know someone else's internal chatter in its purest form. As a third party you receive a version of their thoughts edited by how clearly they articulate themselves or even how gentle they want to be with their words.</p>
        <p>The second filter is the constraints of language. Languages are incredibly restrictive, even more so if you only speak one. How many times have stopped yourself mid-convo because you can't find the words to describe "this" feeling? Have you ever told your partner that words can't describe how much you love them?</p>
        <p>It's even more restrictive when you only speak one language. Language is just a set of words that often fails to convey the full meaning of what you‚Äôre trying to say.</p>
        <p>The third and final filter is yourself. Your brain is a beautiful neural net trained on a series of images, audios, experiences, memories, and people over x amount of years. Like glass over a fire, these training inputs have forged a unique lens for you to look at life through. And just as no one will experience today the same way you will, no one else looks through the same model as you do. That's beautiful. Even if we as people are not much different from the 7.5 billion other people on this planet, maybe our uniqueness instead lies within our worldview. As such, whatever part of themselves another person shares with you is ultimately subject to how you perceive it.</p>
        <p>Due to the three filters, the messages you receive from other people are incomplete simply because you're unaware of their amalgamation of underlying emotions and motives. You could think of them as a blockade to enlightenment. And that frustrates me! I really really want to step into this utterly unknowable realm but I can‚Äôt. At least not yet. </p>
        <p>But then again, walking around in someone's else's mind might only inflame the existing hatred for people that many hold in their heart, being up close with their most deranged preoccupations hidden inside the vessel of the human skull. Oh and how sad would it be to find out that people don't care about you as much as you think they do. Imagine the horrors you might witness firsthand once you gain access to someone else‚Äôs intrusive thoughts. </p>
        <p>But that‚Äôs also the most exciting part of walking around in someone else‚Äôs mind. You gain a glimpse into an entirely new world that takes you beyond the locus of your personal odyssey. It'd be like Spotify wrapped but for the encounters that sculpted their identity from birth until the present moment. I think most importantly, you'd find out just what your actions and words mean to them.</p>
        <p>At the moment, I‚Äôm curious about people‚Äôs idle thoughts. Your internal chatter is suffused by certain topics as you go about your day, without making a conscious effort. For the longest time, I used to idly ruminate on common talking points of capitalism and socialism so that I could figure out where I stood. The reason? I kept seeing political posts on Instagram stories. Constantly exposing myself to the rainbow of political aphorisms rewired my brain to unnecessarily allocate energy towards determining the "right" stance. Today, I'm not sure what the right one is.</p>
        <p>It wasn‚Äôt until a few months ago after I muted a ton of IG stories and Twitter keywords that my mind grew quieter, as ownership over the means of production and the evils of corporate greed disappeared from my daily newsfeeds without me even noticing. I grew less irritable. Then at some point, the internal debate ceased.</p>
        <p>These days, I think a lot about romantic and platonic love. But it‚Äôs funny that my internal debate was simply a byproduct of letting subliminal messages carve themselves into my subconscious. If - even temporarily - my thoughts were a product of THAT, then what am I a product of? What are the people I care about a product of?</p>
        <p>As of now, I‚Äôm still trying to pinpoint my exact motives for understanding people on this atomic of a level. It's either out of love or pure curiosity. This curiosity might be pointless, though. I don't really need to know everything about everyone. I don't think I'd care enough. </p>
        <p>Each of us are living in different worlds on the same planet. I can only feel growing appreciation for all of the people I get to share these moments with. And strangely enough, it was only this year that I've felt the most connected to the rest of the world, being surrounded by the smartest, kindest, and loveliest people I have ever met.</p>
        <p>And just as none of my friends will experience today the same way I will, I will probably never understand their lives as lucidly as my own. But I'm okay with not knowing the unknowable. </p>
