        <h2>motivation</h2>
        <h4 style='color: #ffb9b9;'>july 2020</h4><hr>
        <p>There are two important truths central to the craved state of motivation.</p>
        <p>1. It's simple to get, not easy.</p>
        <p>2. You don't need it.</p>
        <p>Without trying to sound too thought leadership-y, here are 2 ways to gain motivation.</p>
        <h4>[1] Figure yourself out.</h4><br>
        <p>Figure out what you want to do, who you want to become, and why. The easiest way to identify what you like doing is by trying everything and eliminating what you don't enjoy.</p>
        <p>Mark Twain once said that if the first thing you do each morning is eat a live frog, you'll go through the rest of the day with the satisfaction of knowing that is probably the worst thing that is going to happen to you all day long. We usually find ourselves demotivated when faced with menial tasks such as school assignments. It's helpful to view them as frogs you gotta eat in order to move onto more meaningful projects.</p>
        <h4>[2] Do things.</h4><br>
        <p>I learned this the hard way. I used to feel down all the time for not being productive, which made me less productive, thus creating a self-reinforcing cycle. If you're stuck in the same loop, the only way to break out is to sit down and really get to work. I still struggle with emotions getting in the way of productivity (which isn't necessarily bad since emotions are something you must confront with yourself) but the act of doing has helped me most in overcoming it.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the time you spend trying to motivate yourself could be spent doing things that grow your motivation long-term. Planning and thinking about your ambitions is exciting, but it's a way to get pumped up rather than to build a sustained motive.</p>
        <p>I believe another way to think about this is that motivation isn't essential. You will not feel motivated all the time - and that's perfectly fine. What's important is that you keep moving forward despite having temporarily lost the enthusiasm for your project. That energy will return.</p>
